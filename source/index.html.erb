  <h2>who we are</h2>

  <p>
    We are an organization committed to providing outlets 
    and opportunities for the community to get out, get active, 
    and get to know each other through the sport of Ultimate.

  <p>
    All ages and skill levels are welcome. 
    <span>Whether you are a long time veteran or you have never heard of the sport,</span>
    we invite all to come out and participate in any of our events.
    We also want to teach the sport. Signing up for tournaments and leagues is a great way to 
    start learning or be a teacher for others, depending where you find yourself. 
    You can always learn as you go in one of our pick up games. Ultimate is a sport for all. 
    No matter your age, height, skill level, or what kind of shape you are in, 
    <span>there is a place for you on the Ultimate field!</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, the sport of Ultimate is getting more recognition around the world. 
    The sport has a professional league, world tournaments, and is officially 
    eligible to be an Olympic game.
  </p>
  <p>
    We look forward to spreading the great game of Ultimate throughout 
    the community and are available to answer any and all questions. 
    Hope to see you on the field!
